            About us
        </h2>
        <div id="abouttext">
        <p> VoffVoffTryffel was founded a rainy night in Malm√∂ by two friends that share an intense passion for truffles.<br> We were fed up by the fact that its so hard to get a hold of
            truffles.<br>You almost always had to rely on a friendly resturant that is willing to add extra to their truffles orders which made the process long and often very uncertain.<br>
            So that rainy night we decided to create a service that was going to bring truffles to the people.<br> We started reaching out to suppliers and after a carefull we ended up with
            a handful of suppliers that today is the backbone of our supplychain.<br>So if your as passionated about truffles as we are or you just starting out your journey into the <br>
            wonderful world of truffle, let us be your guide and provider!</p>
